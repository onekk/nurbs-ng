## Nurbs WB Next Generation ##

### Main Version

This version is made to follow new way of coding a WB

This will be the master branch probably almost empty for some time.


## Intro

This is a FreeCAD WB inspired from microelly2 work on  **freecad-nurbs** workbench.


### Rationale ###

It is a long term project as the original micorelly WB has some flaws:

  * Is not adapted to python3.
  
  * Custom interface (miki) is not working anymore.
  
  * Many images are lacking and some test present are relying on absent test files.
  
  * There is not trace of the german manual that was supposed to explain some things.


So a total rewrite is needed, after some hour of work on the WB as it was, it is probably better to rework if from the base, adding things gradually.

### Acknowledgement ###

As usual some people have to be thanked:

  * microelly, for the hard work and the generosity to make his code LGPL.
  * many users on FreeCAD forum that have helped me on guessing some parts of the code.
  * FreeCAD developers that hav made possible to have an OpenSource 3d CAD project.

### Helping ###

If interested you could help a little:

  * Help to guess what original code was doing.

  * Contribute with new code.

  * [Funding the project](./docs/FUNDING.md "Funding the project.")
